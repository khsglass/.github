Organization-level README for KHS Glass — showcasing private projects, services, and microservice architecture for our internal web platform.
# 👋 Welcome to KHS Glass

**KHS Glass** is an internal platform built to support the operations of a local glass business. It includes a fully containerized, microservices-based architecture designed for reliability, modularity, and scalability.

🔒 Please note: Most of our repositories are **private**, as this is an ongoing commercial project.
